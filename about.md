## About me

Passionate software engineer with almost 20 years of experience, now and then contributing to open
source projects. Currently building applications (and having fun with Elixir) at
[FindHotel](https://careers.findhotel.net) to get every traveler the best accommodation deal, worldwide.

Amateur basketball player, husband of a beautiful woman, and father of a young promising footballer.

I have been a speaker at many software development conferences like RubyKaigi Japan, RubyConf Brazil,
FISL, TDC São Paulo, TDC Florianópolis, and 7Masters.

Also I like to blog, teach and simply chat about software development (and sports).
