The sentence above is the short answer for the question: "Why was Elixir adopted at FindHotel?"

Check the post [Adopting Elixir at FindHotel](https://blog.findhotel.net/2019/11/adopting-elixir-at-findhotel/)
in the FindHotel blog to read about the details of the adoption.

Listen to the episode [EMx 095: Adopting Elixir at FindHotel with Fernando Hamasaki de Amorim](https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-095-adopting-elixir-at-findhotel-with-fernando-hamasaki-de-amorim)
of the Elixir Mix podcast where I talked with Mark Ericksen about my strategy of introducing Elixir
through hack-a-thons, what kinds of projects work well to start with and tips around learning and
building a team.

We discussed umbrella projects, pattern matching for data transformation, and learning about managing
configuration in Elixir applications and much more.
